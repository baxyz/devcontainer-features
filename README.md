## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the [DevContainers Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) repository and [stuart leeks' dev-container-features](https://github.com/stuartleeks/dev-container-features) for the shell-history concept, with the key difference being project-scoped rather than global user history persistence.
