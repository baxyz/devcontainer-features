- Team collaboration friendly
- Clean separation between personal and project commands

### git-absorb

Installs git-absorb, a tool that automatically absorbs staged changes into their logical commits. Like 'git commit --fixup' but automatic.

**Key benefits:**
- Automatic fixup commits for staged changes
- Multi-architecture support (x86_64, aarch64)
- Git subcommand integration
- Lightweight single binary installation
- Perfect for cleaning up commit history

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the [DevContainers Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) repository and [stuart leeks' dev-container-features](https://github.com/stuartleeks/dev-container-features) for the shell-history concept, with the key difference being project-scoped rather than global user history persistence.
